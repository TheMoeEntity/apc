            <h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ESTATE PLANNING PROCESS</h4>
            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>
              The typical estate planning process will include two in-person
              meetings from introduction to a completed estate plan. Some
              clients might need additional time together to better understand
              their options. I will be available by phone and email while
              drafting your documents to make sure you have a full understanding
              of your documents. <br /> <br />
              For the average estate plan, a draft of your documents will be
              sent to you within approximately 3 weeks of receiving your
              completed Estate Planning Worksheet and supporting documentation.
              Should you need your documents in a rush manner for reasons such
              as a medical procedure or travel, please inform me immediately and
              I will do my best to meet your timeline.
              <br /> <br />
              What should you do to prepare? You donâ€™t need to do anything to
              prepare for our initial meeting other than to fill out the New
              Client Questionnaire. I will guide you through the process of
              developing your estate plan and together will carefully consider
              all options available to you.
